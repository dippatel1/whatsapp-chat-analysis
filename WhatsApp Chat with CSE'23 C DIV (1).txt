🤔Ever thought... what about the ones who are average or below average? Or the ones who have english speaking/ low confidence/ week skill set problem?  What about the ones who are really talented but not allowed to sit for placement bcoz of the CPI criteria? Or the ones who don't have interest in their current field?

Prarambh is back with a thoughtful mind.😌
Back in time when these alumni were in college, there must have been someone who had thought about and made a decision about what you are thinking today! 
Internship or Project?
Service based or product based?
Startup company or MNC?
Core or off?
On campus or Off campus?
Tech or Non-tech?
Business or bank?
Skill or CPI?
Mera placement hoga bhi ?

Get every query answered! Any obstacle, be it a small pebble or a giant rock in your way, get it off the track! 😎

But are we Nirma students being a part of bringing new reforms?
Or are we just happy with a successful career?
Isn't it our responsibility to change the nation?
Lets stop expecting every bit from government and *start changing the nation by a small step!*

11/27/20, 14:08 - Jaan Patel: : Design a system to find the minimum number of Addition/Deletion/Substitution of a single character operations are required to reach from source word to destination word from given dictionary. For example, for dictionary{"KEEN","AIEE","IEE","EEN","MEE","MEA", "AEE"}, minimum number of trials to reach from word "AIEE" to "IEE" is 1. Only 1 operation of deleting character 'A' is required to reach from word "AIEE" to word "IEE". Minimum number of trials to reach from "AICC" to "MCC" is 2(AICC->ICC->MCC) and minimum number of operation to reach from "AIEE" to "MEA" is 3(AIEE->IEE->MEE->MEA). If there are no valid operations with source as "AIEE" and destination as "KEEI" then it should display that "target word can't be reached". Use a Linked list to store the keywords.

12/8/20, 21:37 - Het Cse: 🔰 *CodeAdda Club*

_Here’s a new surprise._
- We are officially shifting to Discord server.

_Here’s why?_
- Discord has many functionality that are not possible in whatsapp, (come-on, you are not kid whatsapp is for normal people, coder uses discord).
- There are many surprises on the way. Okay let me reveal one. In Discord we can do friendly duel, in which two player challenges each other for coding battle, the bot will choose random questions from Codeforces with given difficulty range and some fixed time. One has to solve more question to beat other).
- And obviously, to make the coding culture more better.

10/21/21, 16:05 - Het Patel 174: On behalf of the students who are non-localites, it is difficult to arrange for accommodation during the conduction of semester end examinations in offline mode as the PGs won’t allow for 20 or 25days of stay. They will charge for maybe minimum 6months and Nirma University has not declared clearly whether the next semester will be in offline mode or online mode. Also we have students from all over India and Gulf quota. So, it may be difficult for many students to afford the PG rent if the next semester would be in online mode.
It’s a poll for those who agree with these problems so that we could mention them the approximate number of students who are non-localites and would face this difficulty.
The concerns raised are:
1.	Whether to help in accommodation for the required number of days, or
2.	Give an option of online mode of examination, or
3.	Declare the conduction of next semester in offline mode so that we would arrange our accommodation accordingly.
Those who agree to this add up the number subsequently:
